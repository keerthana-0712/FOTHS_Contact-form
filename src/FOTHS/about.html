        <h2>üî• About FOTHS</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>FOTHS</strong> isn‚Äôt just another Christian app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a vision to create 
      <strong>‚ÄúYour All-in-One Christian Platform.‚Äù</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In today‚Äôs world, believers often juggle multiple apps for Bible study, devotionals, prayer tracking, or Christian media. 
      Each one works in isolation, leaving the experience scattered and incomplete. 
      FOTHS changes that by bringing everything together in one place ‚Äî 
      <strong>Bible reading, spiritual goal tracking, daily verse motivation, prayer journaling, 
      community connections, Christian media, and more</strong> ‚Äî all beautifully integrated and customizable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This platform is built for <strong>every believer</strong> ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre new in faith, a missionary on the move, 
      a student, or a full-time pastor. FOTHS is designed to 
      <strong>inspire, empower, and connect people with God and with one another.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, this project is more than just a placement task or a career move ‚Äî it‚Äôs a 
      <strong>passion-driven mission.</strong> 
      I believe technology can be a powerful tool to spread 
      <strong>hope, truth, and purpose through Christ.</strong> 
      I want to set an example that <strong>faith-rooted projects can be technically excellent, scalable, and impactful</strong> 
      just like any mainstream product.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through FOTHS, I get to combine my technical skills ‚Äî from creative UI/UX design to full-stack development, 
      database management, and secure system implementation ‚Äî with my deeper purpose: 
      <strong>building digital experiences that lead to transformation.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In a world filled with distractions, FOTHS aims to create a 
      <strong>digital space that draws people closer to God, builds community, 
      and sparks revival in the digital age.</strong>
