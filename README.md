## Getting Started
Welcome to the VS Code. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

# FOTHS Website
