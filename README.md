## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.


## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Place all files in the same folder (`homepage.html`, `homepage.css`, `homepage.js`, `logo.png`).
3. Open `homepage.html` in your web browser.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – Page structure
- **CSS3** – Styling & animations (flicker + floating flame)
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Newsletter form functionality
- **SVG** – Scalable flame graphic


## 📧 Newsletter
The form collects email addresses and shows a simple confirmation popup (`Subscribed!`).  
No backend integration is added yet.


## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add **AI chatbot window** when clicking "Chat with Flame".
- Make the design **fully responsive** for mobile & desktop.
- Store newsletter emails in a backend database.
- Add animations to the chatbot button.
